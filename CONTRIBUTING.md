2. Do report suggestions for enhancements
3. Let me know if this runs successfully on an operating system I have not listed yet (see [README](README.md))
4. Add more exotic compression algorithm when you use them successfully (see [here](https://github.com/cytopia/mysqldump-secure/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md#122-compression))
5. Extend the [Example](https://github.com/cytopia/mysqldump-secure/blob/master/doc/EXAMPLES.md) section
